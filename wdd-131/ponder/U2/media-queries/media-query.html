            <h2>Deuteronomy 7:3-4</h2>
            <p>
                3. Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.
                4. For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.

            <h2>Matthew 24:5-8</h2>
            <p>
                5. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
                6. And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
                7. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
                8. All these are the beginning of sorrows.
