            <h2>What is Investing?</h2>

            <p>Investing involves putting your money into assets—such as stocks, bonds, and real estate—with the goal of
                growing your wealth over time. Unlike traditional saving, which typically offers lower returns,
                investing has the potential to generate higher earnings. It's a key strategy for building long-term
                financial security.</p>

            <h2>Types of Investments</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Buying stocks means owning a small piece of a company. While stocks can be
                    volatile, they offer the potential for high returns if managed wisely.</li>
                <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> When you invest in bonds, you're essentially lending money to governments or
                    corporations in exchange for interest over time. Bonds are generally considered safer than stocks
                    but typically offer lower returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Mutual Funds and ETFs:</strong> These investment vehicles allow you to invest in a
                    diversified portfolio of assets. This diversification helps reduce the risk associated with
                    individual investments, making them a popular choice for new investors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Risk vs. Reward</h2>

            <p>A critical concept to understand in investing is the balance between risk and reward. Typically, the
                higher the potential return, the higher the risk. It's important to assess your own risk tolerance and
                choose investments that align with your financial goals and time horizon.</p>

            <h2>The Power of Compound Interest</h2>

            <p>One of the most powerful tools in investing is <strong>compound interest</strong>—the ability for your
                investments to generate earnings, which are then reinvested to create additional earnings. Over time,
                this can lead to exponential growth, making early and consistent investing extremely beneficial.</p>

            <h2>Long-Term vs. Short-Term Investing</h2>

            <p>When it comes to investing, it's essential to distinguish between <strong>long-term</strong> and
                <strong>short-term</strong> strategies. Long-term investments—typically held for several years—are more
                likely to yield better results, especially when factoring in the power of compound interest. On the
                other hand, short-term investments may suit those who are willing to take on more risk for potentially
                quicker returns.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Start Investing</h2>

            <p>Starting your investment journey is simpler than you might think. Begin by setting clear financial goals,
                opening an investment account, and focusing on low-cost, diversified funds like index funds or ETFs. For
                those new to investing, starting small and gradually increasing your contributions over time is a great
                way to build confidence and grow your portfolio.</p>
