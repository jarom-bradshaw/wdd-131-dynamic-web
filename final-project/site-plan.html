			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
                The purpose of this financial website is to provide users with easy-to-understand financial resources and tools for budgeting, saving, and
                investing. The site will also offer expert advice on managing personal finances, investment strategies, and tips for financial success.
            </p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
                This website is aimed at individuals who are looking to improve their financial literacy, from beginners to those with some experience in 
                personal finance. The target audience includes young professionals, families, and anyone interested in becoming more financially savvy.
            </p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>JavaScript will be used to enhance the interactivity of the site. Some dynamic elements will include:
                
                <ul>
                <li>Interactive Budget Calculator: Users can input their income and expenses, and the site will dynamically calculate their budget breakdown.</li>
                <li>Investment Portfolio Tracker: This will allow users to enter their investments and track the performance of stocks or bonds.</li>
                <li>Interactive Charts: Using JavaScript libraries like Chart.js, we will create dynamic charts to show income versus expenses or portfolio performance.</li>
                <li>Responsive Navigation: The navigation bar will adapt to different screen sizes (mobile/desktop), making it interactive and user-friendly.</li>
                <li>Event Listeners: Clicking on financial tips or articles will reveal hidden content or take the user to a detailed page.</li>
			    </ul>
                <br><sub>NOTE: I plan on doing 2 of these for now and maybe expanding it for a future resume project. Do you have advice on two to choose that 
                    will help me learn more? I am leaning towards Interactive Charts and a Budget Calculator that will be like a form. I think that will hit the 
                    requirements for the project.
                </sub>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
            
			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/0d141e-06c4ed-42be33-0696d0-ffffff"
				target="_blank"
				>https://coolors.co/0d141e-06c4ed-42be33-0696d0-ffffff</a
			>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#06C4ED]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#0D141E]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#42BE33]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#0696D0]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: IM Fell French Canon SC
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Lato
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
            <p><sub>I really like these font's. Do I have to choose new ones?</sub></p>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				This color scheme will provide a professional and clean look suitable
                for a financial website, with an emphasis on trust and success.


			</p>
			<h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
			<p class="colored">
				The font choice will provide a classic, trustworthy feel through the 
                heading font and come with a modern and readable feeling for the
                paragraph font to help customers feel more at ease with trusting the 
                site. 
			</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is Investing?</strong> Investing involves putting your money into assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) with the goal of growing your wealth. Unlike saving, which generally offers lower returns, investing has the potential to generate higher earnings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Types of Investments:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Ownership in a company. Stocks can be volatile but offer potential for high returns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> A loan to the government or corporations. Generally safer but offer lower returns compared to stocks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mutual Funds and ETFs:</strong> These allow you to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets, reducing individual risk.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Risk vs. Reward:</strong> Understand the balance between risk and return. Generally, the higher the potential return, the higher the risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compound Interest:</strong> The ability of your investments to generate earnings that are reinvested to generate their own earnings. This can lead to exponential growth over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Long-Term vs. Short-Term Investing:</strong> Long-term investments typically yield better results over time due to compound interest, while short-term investments are more suited for those willing to accept more risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>How to Start Investing:</strong> Begin by setting clear financial goals, opening an investment account, and starting with low-cost, diversified funds like index funds or ETFs. Start small and build up over time.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				I did a quick mockup. I will probably do another one in color and research a bit
				more before I start coding. I wanted to get this done quickly so I can finish the class.
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				I am curious if you know any good tutorials to learn how to do this sliding type object I am 
				going to put financial quotes on and have it slide between them.

			<h3>Financial Calculator</h3>
			<p>
				This idea was inspired by the Church of Jesus Christ's financial calculators
				available on their website. My design looks relatively similar to theirs right now. 
				I am thinking on how to change the design, but wanted to quickly do a mockup wireframe,
				and get your feedback on whether this is a good idea or not.

				The content still needs to be fully developed. But this is a mockup wireframe I made to show what I'm hoping to do.
